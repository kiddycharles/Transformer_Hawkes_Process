# Transformer_Hawkes_Process
The Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) is a novel deep learning model that combines the power of Transformer architectures with the flexibility of Hawkes processes, making it suitable for modeling and forecasting complex temporal point processes. Temporal point processes are widely used to model event sequences in various domains.
